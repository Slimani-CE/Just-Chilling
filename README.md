# Just-Chilling
A text encrypter 

So now you can choose a form to start with,(ascii code , text or a binary code) 
If you choose a text, so you can convert it:
# to an ascii code
  *the ascii code is a list of numbers with no space between each code
  Like:  
         input : "AAA"
         Output: "656565"

# to a binary code as the next:

         Input : "AAA"
         Output: "010000010100000101000001"

!!!! 
  When we want to enter a binary code or an ascii code to convert it to a text
  The inputted code shouldn't be separated by space,
  Should be like the next:

      Input : "01000001"
      Output: "A"

      Intput: "65666597"
      Output: "ABAa"
